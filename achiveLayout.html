			<article>CAI once wrote that huawei was the only true supplier of 5G commercial equipment in an article about how to beat a dog with a stick. Some friends said that what I wrote was too exaggerated. I have also seen a variety of controversial discussions in the past two days (most of which are based on an article by CSIS, from which the figure above is taken), for which I specially interviewed the head of a well-known European network operator in China (who is not a Chinese national). The friend told me several facts objectively:


1. A few years ago, many operators in the industry would laugh at the domestic evaluation of huawei and feel that they have too much water. However, huawei has long been a very international company, and the number and value of patents granted by huawei are second to none in the industry, which is beyond doubt.


2. The standard for evaluating a device service provider is not to rank all its devices one by one, which obviously has the tendency of the United States. Firstly, whether huawei is a leader in technology or not, and secondly, it should comprehensively evaluate its entire service level and supply chain system. From this perspective, huawei has no competitors in the world.


3. It is obviously not objective to compare qualcomm and huawei on 5G. Qualcomm mainly produces chips, while huawei mainly provides 5G hardware equipment. If factors such as XX station are not taken into account, 5G hardware products provided by huawei have a competitive advantage in cost performance. When countries invite tenders, the first factor they consider is cost and technical quality.


So why does the United States resist huawei when it has qualcomm and cisco?


The answer is that huawei is exporting standards that will change the layout of related industries around the world.


PS: I will continue to write tomorrow. In short, 5g-related companies are worth holding for a long time. In this critical period, the joint construction of 5G networks by China telecom and China unicom will bring about changes in the entire industry and ultimately affect all aspects of our lives
